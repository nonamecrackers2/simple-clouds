# Contributing Guidelines

Suggestions, bug reports, and pull requests are extremely valuable towards the development of Simple Clouds, and we love to see new ideas and are open to feedback and suggestions. Bug reports are also extremely important towards the development of this mod, and community contributions help make this project as polished as it can be. **Before contributing** (either through opening a new issue or a pull request), **please take a moment to read this document in its entirety, as failure to do so can result in your contributions being closed and marked as invalid!**

## Issues

Before opening a new issue, please **use the search function to search for issues** that may be related to your bug report/feature. It is possible that we are already aware of a bug, and that someone has already suggested your idea. **We will let you know if your issue is a duplicate and will close your issue**, but we understand that looking for existing issues that are related to yours can be difficult and thus there are no repercussions for doing so.

We expect all issues to be made in English, with correct spelling and proper grammar if possible. We cannot understand issues made in other languages and is why this requirement exists.

### Questions/Support

This repository is not the place for general questions/support, so do not open an issue requesting such. Our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/cracker-s-modded-community-987817685293355028) is a far more suitable place for general discussion, support, and questions related to Simple Clouds.

### Bug Reports

Before opening a bug report, please do the following:
- Read our [notes about compatibility](https://github.com/nonamecrackers2/simple-clouds/wiki/Compatibility) to make sure you aren't opening an issue we're already aware about.
- Ensure that all mods, including Simple Clouds, **are up to date**, and that you are using a **Minecraft version that is actively supported by Simple Clouds**, unless if you consider the issue you are experiencing as a critical bug.
- Check to see if your **graphics drivers are up to date**, and if they are not, **update them** and **see if the issue persists**.
- While we understand this may not always be possible, **make sure you can accurately replicate your bug with precise, and concise, set of steps to reproduce the issue.**
- If your issue is due to a **conflict with other mods, narrow down the mod** (or set of mods) that is causing the issue. Provide the name of the mod and the version you are using that is causing it.
- **Include all required information** in the bug report form.

### Features/Suggestions

Before opening a feature/suggestion/idea issue, please do the following:
- Make sure your feature/suggestion/idea has not already been suggested (as outlined above) and that **it is not already planned or exists in the mod.** Make sure you are playing with the latest version to understand what all exists.
- **Include all required information** in the feature request form.

Please ensure your suggestion, feature, or idea aligns with the core vision of Simple Clouds. We will close your issue and will always try to explain our reasoning as to why we believe it doesn't align with our vision. Use the following to guide your ideas:

> Simple Clouds attempts to mimic real-life weather and cloud formations in a stylized, ambient, and aesthetic way that is meant to build on to the vanilla Minecraft experience.

**DO NOT suggest your idea if it relates to:**
- Making Simple Clouds more realistic,
- Plainly stating "improve performance/optimize this" without any suggestions as to how

_Failure to follow any of these requirements will result in your issue being closed and marked as invalid._
